# Meeting 1: ICON_EDITOR_ANIMATION_TRIGGER_FIX

## Architect
Expose missing animation trigger fields in the icon editor animations tab and ensure hit-test entries (including orb pickup) are surfaced prominently for easy configuration.

## Developer
Locate the animations tab UI for the player icon editor, restore/enable the trigger selector or input, and reorder the hit-test action list to place test hit-test orb (and similar entries) at the top. Add or adjust tests to cover the new ordering and trigger field rendering.

## Analyst
Change aligns with usability goals; ensure no regressions in icon editor configuration storage. Verify that trigger data flows through to saved configuration and cover edge cases in tests.

## Secretary
Summary: Council agrees to restore the missing trigger field in the animations tab and prioritize hit-test orb-related entries at the top, with tests verifying rendering and ordering.
