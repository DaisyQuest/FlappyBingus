# Council Meeting 1: Icon Editor Anim Trigger Update

## Architect
We need to reflect new deterministic anim:* triggers in the icon editor and ensure the UI accounts for metadata, suppression, and dedupe behavior.

## Developer
Implement updates where the icon editor listens for engine event bus anim triggers, update any adapters, and expand headless tests for ordering and scenarios.

## Analyst
Ensure changes align with deterministic trigger emission and expand tests to cover edge cases for suppression/dedupe and ordering to avoid regressions.

## Secretary
The council agrees to update the icon editor to consume new anim:* triggers with metadata and to add thorough headless tests covering emission, ordering, suppression, and scenario expectations.
