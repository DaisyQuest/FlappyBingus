# Animation Target Filtering Work Order

- [x] Locate the animations screen filtering logic for animations and targets.
- [x] Update filtering so selecting an animation hides incompatible targets while preserving target-first filtering.
- [x] Add/adjust tests to cover animation-first and target-first filtering, including edge cases.
- [x] Run relevant test suite(s) and ensure coverage for new branches.
