# Replay-to-Leaderboard Checklist

- [x] Capture and sanitize best-run replays when submitting new personal best scores, persisting them in Mongo.
- [x] Expose replay availability and fetch endpoints so leaderboard entries can be watched safely.
- [x] Refresh the leaderboard UI into a card-based layout with clear watch actions and status affordances.
- [x] Add thorough automated tests covering replay sanitization, persistence, and service behavior.
