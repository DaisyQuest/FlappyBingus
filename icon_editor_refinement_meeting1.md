# Icon Editor Refinement Meeting 1

## Architect
Focus on simplifying the icon editor interface by replacing example hex swatches with a standard hex input and clarifying animation applicability per target.

## Developer
Add a hex color input control, add UI hints or disabled states for unsupported animation types per target, and ensure interactions remain performant.

## Analyst
Ensure the UI changes do not alter gameplay systems; prioritize clear affordances and prevent no-op animation selections.

## Secretary
The council agrees to improve the icon editor UI with a standard hex input and clearer animation targeting so users avoid no-op selections while keeping gameplay unaffected.
