# Council Meeting: Test Assertion Expansion (Meeting 1)

## Architect
Focus on identifying class behaviors lacking assertions; expand tests to validate outputs and side effects, aiming for strong branch coverage.

## Developer
Target existing service/handler classes and add missing assertions; add at least 50 new tests in current Vitest suites.

## Analyst
Ensure new tests are meaningful (not just existence) and cover error branches; keep changes limited to tests.

## Secretary
Summary: Expand tests with concrete assertions across classes, ensure branch coverage, and add >=50 meaningful tests while limiting scope to test files.
