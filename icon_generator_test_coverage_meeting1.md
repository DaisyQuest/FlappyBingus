# Council Meeting 1: Icon Generator Test Coverage

## Architect
We need comprehensive, branch-complete tests around the icon generator feature. Focus on the generator's public APIs and any integration points that are part of the spec.

## Developer
We should identify the generator module(s), enumerate all branches (including error handling), and add unit/integration tests to hit all paths. We'll confirm expected outputs with fixtures or deterministic mocks.

## Analyst
Ensure tests cover invalid inputs, boundary conditions, and failure modes. Avoid brittle tests; prefer stable fixtures and explicit assertions. Keep alignment with existing test conventions.

## Secretary
Summary: The council agrees to target full branch coverage for the icon generator, covering success paths, edge cases, and error handling with stable, deterministic tests and fixtures.
