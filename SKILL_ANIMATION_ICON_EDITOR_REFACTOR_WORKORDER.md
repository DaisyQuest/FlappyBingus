# Work Order: Skill Animation Icon Editor Refactor

- [x] Inspect current animation trigger system and icon editor flow to identify where skill-triggered animations fail.
- [x] Refactor icon editor to transition into a dedicated editing screen with clear per-trigger animation controls and preview context.
- [x] Ensure each icon supports idle animation (optional) plus one animation per trigger.
- [x] Update preview UX to show which trigger/animation is active and being edited.
- [x] Add headless simulation tests validating trigger activation, duration, idle behavior, and edge cases to reach ~95% coverage.
- [x] Update/add any supporting types or data mappings needed for per-trigger animations.
- [x] Run relevant tests and ensure coverage targets are met.
