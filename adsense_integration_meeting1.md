# Ads Integration Council Meeting 1

## Architect
Replace CPALead provider references and ensure AdSense script is included in page headers consistently without altering unrelated ad flows.

## Developer
Identify CPALead references in server/db config and tests, update provider handling to new AdSense infrastructure, and add head script insertion in appropriate HTML/template files.

## Analyst
Ensure removal of CPALead does not break ad-related code paths; update tests to cover new provider and script injection logic.

## Secretary
Summary: The council agrees to remove CPALead references, add AdSense script to headers, and update related tests and provider handling to keep ad flows stable.
