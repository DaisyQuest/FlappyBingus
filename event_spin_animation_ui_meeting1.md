# Council Meeting 1: Event Spin Animation UI

## Architect
Add icon editor controls for event-triggered pattern rotation and update the animation engine so pattern rotation can be event-driven (orb pickup) while respecting reduced-motion rules.

## Developer
Expose a triggeredBy field plus quick-add buttons for orb/perfect spin animations in the editor, and update sampling/tests to support event-driven patternRotate with full coverage.

## Analyst
Ensure event-driven patternRotate uses event timing, honors reduced motion policy, and update tests to cover new branches and UI wiring.

## Secretary
Summary: Add editor buttons and triggeredBy input for event-triggered spins, implement event-driven patternRotate sampling, and expand tests for engine and editor behaviors.
