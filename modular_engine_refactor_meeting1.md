# Council Meeting 1: Modular Engine Refactor

## Architect
Focus on extracting reusable game engine utilities from main.js/game.js, ensuring clear interfaces and minimal coupling. Prioritize deterministic behavior and testability.

## Developer
Propose splitting common game loop helpers and state mutation into small modules with pure functions. Add unit tests for new modules and edge cases.

## Analyst
Ensure refactor does not change gameplay behavior. Add tests to cover key branches and prevent regressions.

## Secretary
Summary: The council agrees to modularize core logic into focused utilities with clear interfaces, while adding thorough tests to preserve behavior and cover edge cases.

## Arbiters
