# Background Parallax Fix Work Order

## Tasks
- [x] Locate background parallax/scaling logic tied to player Y movement.
- [x] Remove Y-based scaling so the background stays anchored to its original position.
- [x] Implement bounded local drift for stars and nebulas around their spawn positions.
- [x] Update/add tests to cover new background drift behavior and ensure no Y-scaling.
- [x] Run relevant tests.
