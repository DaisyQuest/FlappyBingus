# Pipe Stroke Border Council Meeting 1

## Architect
We should add pipe stroke styling without altering hitbox size and expose stroke color controls in the palette studio.

## Developer
Plan: add stroke rendering to pipe draw path using a configurable stroke color/width set to default black; update palette studio UI and storage to include stroke color; add tests for stroke width 0 vs >0 ensuring geometry unchanged.

## Analyst
Ensure rendering only, no collision geometry changes; include tests that validate bounds or collision dimensions remain constant when stroke is applied.

## Secretary
Summary: Council agrees to add configurable pipe stroke rendering with default black, update palette studio to edit stroke color, and add thorough tests ensuring collision size unchanged for stroke width 0 and nonzero.
