# Council Meeting 1: Update Ad Iframe

## Architect
The change should update the ad embed source to the new fastrsrvr list URL and ensure any sandbox/size attributes remain consistent with project standards.

## Developer
Locate the current ad iframe in the frontend markup and swap the src to the provided link. Update or add tests to cover the change and any rendering logic.

## Analyst
Ensure the iframe sandbox attributes remain secure and unchanged beyond the src update. Verify tests cover both existing and updated iframe scenarios to prevent regressions.

## Secretary
