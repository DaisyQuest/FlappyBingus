# Work Order: Main.js Modular Refactor

- [x] Inspect main.js to identify subsystems and shared state.
- [x] Define module boundaries and create new module files with documentation.
- [x] Introduce central orchestrator wiring modules together.
- [x] Add performance-focused abstractions (caches/pools) without behavior change.
- [x] Update imports/call sites to new modules and remove dead code/globals.
- [x] Add/expand tests to cover new module behavior and branches.
- [x] Run relevant test suite(s) and ensure they pass.
