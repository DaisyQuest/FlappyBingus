# Work Order: Branch Coverage Tests

- [x] Review existing tests and coverage configuration (vitest config, scripts).
- [x] Identify branch gaps in main.js and game.js (guest/auth flows, state transitions, error handling).
- [x] Add meaningful tests to cover missing branches with deterministic fixtures.
- [x] Provide analysis on refactoring main.js and game.js, including guidance on pipes modularization.
- [x] Run relevant tests and ensure coverage gains are documented.
