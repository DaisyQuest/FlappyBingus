# Council Meeting 1: Modular Engine Refactor Continuation

## Architect
Further split large functions in main.js/game.js into focused modules with clear contracts. Preserve behavior while improving testability.

## Developer
Extract pure utilities (e.g., shared formatting, state normalization) and add tests covering edge cases and branch logic.

## Analyst
Ensure refactor does not introduce regressions; expand unit tests to cover critical branches.

## Secretary
Summary: Continue modularizing core logic into isolated helpers with thorough tests to preserve behavior and reduce coupling.
