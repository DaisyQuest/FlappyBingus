# Council Meeting 1: tutorial_refinement

## Architect
The tutorial flow should prioritize essential mechanics. Remove redundant dash and slow field steps, move teleport later, and reposition popup text for visibility.

## Developer
Implement UI positioning for tutorial popup text to top-middle while keeping box top-left. Adjust tutorial phase sequencing: move teleport to phase 5, remove dash, dash-bounce, slow field tutorials. Update tests to reflect new flow and ensure thorough coverage.

## Analyst
Changes align with goal of faster onboarding and clearer instructions. Ensure removal of steps doesn't leave unreachable states and that tests validate phase order and UI positioning.

## Secretary
Summary: Council agrees to streamline tutorial by removing redundant dash/slow field steps, moving teleport to phase 5, and repositioning popup text for visibility while keeping tutorial box top-left. Tests must be updated for new phase order and coverage.
