# Sync Server Simplification Work Order

- [x] Audit current sync/login flows to identify repeated logins and icon filter logic issues.
- [x] Implement single-call player data sync endpoint or handler returning consistent state.
- [x] Ensure icon editor selections persist to DB (beyond HighVis Orange) and are returned by sync.
- [x] Fix icon filter logic so /iconEditor icons appear where expected.
- [x] Add/expand tests to cover all new branches and ensure no logout side effects.
- [x] Run relevant test suite(s) and capture results.
