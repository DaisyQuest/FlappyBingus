# Council Meeting 1 - Unlockables Catalog Tests

## Architect
Focus on covering buildUnlockablesCatalog edge cases: invalid entries, unlock precedence, and minScore normalization paths.

## Developer
Plan to add targeted vitest cases in services/__tests__/unlockables.spec.js for trails, icons, and pipeTextures invalid inputs and precedence between requiresRecordHolder/alwaysUnlocked/unlock/minScore.

## Analyst
Ensure tests assert invalid entries are excluded and unlock types reflect precedence rules; include non-number minScore handling to hit default paths.

## Secretary
Summary: Add thorough unlockables catalog tests for invalid items across arrays, precedence of unlock flags, and non-number minScore defaults.
